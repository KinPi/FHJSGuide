## Chapter 12:

1. Object literal still has uses compared to object constructors. (e.g. pass in a params object)
2. typeof tells you the type of operand. If it's an object, it will say object but cannot be more specific.
3. instanceof is used to determine if an object is an instance of a certain Constructor. (e.g. cat instanceof Cat) returns true if cat was created using a Cat constructor.
4. Javascript doesn't have a strong sense of an object's type.
5. If you remove or add properties to an instance of a "class", it is still an instance of that "class".
6. [] is shorthand for Array constructor.
7. An object literal is an instance of Object.
