1. Variables can also have $ anywhere.
2. Single quotes also work for strings.
3. Case sensitive
4. == checks equality of content
5. document.write(string)
6. <head> loads before <body> If code is in <head>, it takes longer for user to see the page. If in body, users will see the page while they wait for the code to load.
7. External file in head – separation of concerns, still needs to be loaded before body of the page
8. External file in body, bottom of body – separation of concerns, loaded after the body above.
9. Non boolean boolean
10. No int division. Use Math.floor(int)
11. 1000 + “108” is okay
