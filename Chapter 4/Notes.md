## Chapter 4 - Arrays:

1. Javascript arrays has a list syntax. (i.e. [a, b])
2. You get undefined if you try to access items that are out-of-bounds index items in the array.
3. myArray.push(item) adds new item to end of array.
4. Sparse arrays are arrays that have values in only a few indices. The rest are undefined.
