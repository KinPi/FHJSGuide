## Chapter 11:

1. Function declarations at the top level of your code create functions that are defined everywhere in your code (known as hoisting).
2. You can declare functions within functions.
3. When you return a function, you also return its environment that was attached to it.
4. Closure is a function together with a referencing environment.
5. According to Wikipedia, closure is a technique for implementing scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions.
6. Free variables are variables that aren't defined locally in a function.
7. Closing a function refers to having an environment that has a value for each of the free values.
8. The closure contains an actual environment, not a copy. If a value is changed by code outside your closure function, that new value is seen by your closure function when it is evaluated.
9. Lexical scope means that we determine the scope of a variable by reading our code.
