## Chapter 6 - Getting to know the DOM:

1. DOM = Document Object Model, browser's internal representation of your web page
2. When you load a page into the browser, the browser parses the HTML and renders it to display. It also creates
a set of object that represents your markup and those object are stored in the DOM.
3. The innerHTML property holds the text content, as well as all nested HTML content, of an element.
4. When Javascript updates the DOM, the browser updates the page dynamically.
5. If you have code that you want to execute after the whole page has been loaded, use "window.onload = init", where
init is a callback function.
6. Callback == event handler
